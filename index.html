        <h3>Deep Dive into F1 (SQL Project)</h3>
        <p>Using a Formula One database in SQL, my group researched everything that goes into success on the track. By creating custom queries that look at performance across different constructors, teams with the best pit stops, and more. Presenting it with Tableau we found F1 is a complex sport that has continued to evolve over the years.</p>
